# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends.
Using a large database of kickstarter information, such as goal amount, amount pledged, the date the kickstarter began and the date it ended, type of project the kickstarter was for, etc.  This information was used to determine the trends of successful kickstarter campaigns as well as failed kickstarter campaigns.

The analysis concludes that the best time for Louise to start a kickstarter campaign would be in the end of May or the beginning of June.  The successful kickstarter campaigns for plays tend to have lower goal amounts than the failed campaigns did.  Louise should aim to have her goal amount to be around $2k-$3k.
